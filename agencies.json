    "review": "Overall, great work. Best deal you are going to find for the price. Just be sure to outline the details of the project very clearly at the outset. They are very optimistic in their estimations, so just be prepared for that. However, even in going slightly over the estimate, I found their work to be completed at a price much lower than competitors. And when an issue emerged, Naveen went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied, even working on it at no fee. Overall, I was very impressed with the quality of work, speed, and the price. Would recommend to others.",
